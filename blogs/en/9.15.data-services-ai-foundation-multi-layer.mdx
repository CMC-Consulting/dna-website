To build a truly effective and scalable AI system, businesses need a tightly integrated multi-tiered architecture instead of just using disparate models. **CMC Consulting** provides a comprehensive **AI Foundation** architecture design solution, optimizing everything from infrastructure power to end-user experience.

A standard AI system architecture includes the following core layers:

• **Model Layer:** This is the "brain" of the system, integrating foundation models. We support both closed models (such as GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini) to maximize performance and open-source models (such as LLaMA 3, Mistral) to optimize costs and internal data security.

• **Orchestration Layer:** This acts as the "operating system" connecting models with data and business processes. Through tools like **n8n, LangChain**, or **Power Automate**, the system can automate complex workflows, coordinate AI agents to perform tasks, and manage interaction states.

• **Infrastructure Layer:** Provides the computing and storage power necessary for AI tasks.

• **Compute:** Utilizes powerful **GPU/TPU** clusters on leading cloud computing platforms such as Azure, AWS, or GCP to ensure processing speed.

• **Storage & Vector Database:** Integrates modern data storage and **Vector Databases** (such as Pinecone, Weaviate) to support the RAG architecture, enabling AI to accurately retrieve enterprise knowledge.

• **Experience Layer:** Transforming the power of technology into useful tools such as virtual assistants (Copilots), intelligent dashboards, and natural conversational programming (NLP) interfaces for end users.

**Why is multi-tier architecture important?** This approach helps businesses avoid dependence on a single vendor (vendor lock-in), easily upgrade new technology components, and ensure security and compliance throughout the data lifecycle.
