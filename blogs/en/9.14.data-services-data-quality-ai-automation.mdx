In the age of artificial intelligence, data not only needs to be "abundant" but also reliable, consistent, and secure for AI models to operate effectively. At **CMC Consulting**, we understand that a successful data strategy doesn't start with technology, but with establishing a solid foundation of Data Quality.

We apply **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to revolutionize information quality management processes, helping businesses achieve the goal of "Single version of truth" through groundbreaking features:

• **Automatic anomaly detection and interpretation:** Instead of dry error reporting, GenAI analyzes data rule violations and explains the root cause in natural language, helping operations teams understand and resolve issues immediately.

• **Intelligent Rule Suggestion Assistant:** Based on data profile analysis, AI automatically suggests quality control rules such as null value checking, valid value ranges, or duplicate detection, optimizing system setup time.

• **Natural Language Rule Setup:** Allows business users to create technical rules without needing programming knowledge. For example: "Ensure customer age is between 18 and 99", the system will automatically convert it into corresponding SQL code or validation logic.

• **Automated Data Augmentation and Cleaning:** AI suggests transformation strategies, normalizes chaotic data, and intelligently fills in missing values ​​based on context, ensuring data is always ready for analysis.

• **Data Observability Bot:** A specialized AI assistant continuously monitors the data flow, summarizes anomalies, and suggests timely corrective actions, ensuring data health throughout its lifecycle.

**Benefits:** By integrating AI into quality management processes, businesses not only meet audit and compliance requirements (especially in the finance and banking sector) but also create a source of "clean" data to accelerate decision-making and optimize advanced GenAI applications.
