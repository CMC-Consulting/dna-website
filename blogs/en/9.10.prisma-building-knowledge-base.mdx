As digital transformation accelerates across Vietnam, businesses increasingly struggle to manage and utilize internal knowledge effectively. Data is scattered across databases, SVN repositories, Google Drive, SharePoint, PDF/Excel files, and even recorded meeting audio — leading to wasted search time and risk of information loss. **Prisma**, CMC Consulting’s Private AI solution, helps organizations build an **intelligent digital knowledge base** where data is not only stored but brought to life through seamless integration and advanced outputs such as mind maps and podcasts.

This article provides a step-by-step guide for Vietnamese enterprises to deploy Prisma and transform internal data into actionable intelligence. With on-premise or self-hosted deployment, Prisma ensures maximum security and compliance with Vietnam’s Digital Technology Law and Cybersecurity Law.

## Why Businesses Need an Intelligent Knowledge Base

For enterprises, a knowledge base (KB) should be more than a storage repository — it should function as a “digital brain” that supports fast, informed decision-making. However, SMEs often lack large IT teams, causing data to remain “dormant” across disconnected tools. Prisma addresses this by offering:

- **Multi-source integration:** Connect Confluence, SharePoint, Google Drive, OneDrive, Jira, Slack, and more  
- **Source-grounded AI:** Every response is tied to internal sources with citations, eliminating hallucinations  
- **Creative outputs:** Generate mind maps, podcasts, reports, or Q&A from raw data  
- **SME-friendly deployment:** Affordable, simple to implement, no AI specialists required  

According to McKinsey’s 2026 research, Vietnamese SMEs can increase productivity by 20–30% with intelligent knowledge base systems, particularly in banking, insurance, and manufacturing.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building an Intelligent Knowledge Base with Prisma

Prisma simplifies KB creation into just a few essential steps. Assume you have already registered for a free demo (details at the end).

### Step 1: Prepare and Integrate Data Sources

- Deploy Prisma on-premise (internal servers) or via a private cloud. CMC’s team can complete setup in 30–60 minutes.  
- Integrate your tools:
  - **Notion:** Sync pages and databases via API (e.g., SOP processes for training KB)  
  - **Confluence:** Import wiki articles and documentation (ideal for legal contract repositories)  
  - **SharePoint:** Pull files such as PDFs or Excel reports (common in banking finance departments)  

**How-to:** In the Prisma interface, go to **Connectors → Add API Key → Select Source → Enable Auto Sync**. Prisma supports text, audio, and video formats.

### Step 2: Upload and Process Internal Data

- Upload files manually or automatically through integrations. Prisma uses embeddings to index content, making it vector-searchable.  
- Multi-modal processing: Upload a meeting video → Prisma extracts transcripts and summaries.  
- **SME tip:** Start with 10–20 representative files (e.g., sales procedures from Notion) for initial testing.

### Step 3: Build an Intelligent KB with Queries & Advanced Outputs

- Use the chat interface to query your KB:  
  *“Summarize the credit appraisal process from Notion and Confluence files.”*  
  Results include citations.  

- Generate a **mind map:** Select “Mindmap” output to visualize insights (e.g., financial risk maps from Excel reports).  
- Create a **podcast:** Convert financial reports from SharePoint into a 5–10 minute audio summary with natural voice.  

**How-to:** After querying, select **Output Options → Mindmap/Podcast → Export** (PNG for mind maps, MP3 for podcasts).

### Step 4: Integrate into Daily Workflows

- Connect Prisma with Slack or Microsoft Teams for quick knowledge queries in group chats  
- Set access permissions (e.g., R&D sees production data; Legal sees contracts)  
- Automatic updates: When sources change (e.g., a Notion edit), the KB syncs automatically

### Step 5: Monitor and Expand

- Track usage through dashboards: number of queries, popular sources  
- Expand capabilities by adding AI models (e.g., Grok for creative tasks, DeepSeek for cost efficiency)

## Real-World Use Cases for Vietnamese Businesses

- **Small and mid-sized banks:** Integrate SharePoint (financial Excel reports) + Notion (State Bank regulations) → Create bad debt risk mind maps or quarterly meeting summary podcasts  
- **Insurance companies:** Combine Confluence (policy templates) + meeting recordings → Query “Exclusion clause for disease X” → Generate explanation podcasts for agents  
- **Manufacturers:** Use Notion (production SOPs) + test videos → Create mind maps to optimize LED parameters and shorten R&D cycles  

These examples show how SMEs save hours each week while improving efficiency without complex IT systems.

## Key Benefits of Building a Knowledge Base with Prisma

- **Security & compliance:** Data stays within your infrastructure, reducing risks compared to public cloud AI  
- **Cost efficiency:** No need to purchase multiple tools; Prisma unifies everything affordably  
- **Ease of use:** Friendly interface, no coding required — ideal for non-technical organizations  
- **Flexibility:** Custom mind maps and podcasts, strong Vietnamese language support
