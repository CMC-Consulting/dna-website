  As digital transformation accelerates across Vietnam, enterprises often struggle to manage and leverage their internal knowledge assets. Data is scattered across databases, SVN, Google Drive, SharePoint, PDF/Excel files, and even recorded meetings — leading to wasted search time and information loss risks. **Prisma** – CMC Consulting’s Private AI solution – helps you build a **smart digital knowledge base** where information is not only stored, but brought to life through seamless integration and advanced outputs like mind maps and podcasts.

  This article provides a step-by-step guide for Vietnamese enterprises to deploy Prisma and transform internal data into actionable intelligence. With on-premise/self-hosted deployment, Prisma ensures absolute data security and compliance with Vietnam’s Digital Technology Law 2026 and Cybersecurity Law.

  ## Why Do Enterprises Need a Smart Digital Knowledge Base?

  For businesses, a Knowledge Base (KB) is more than storage — it is a “digital brain” that supports faster decision-making. However, many SMEs lack large IT resources, causing valuable data to remain “dormant” in separate tools. Prisma solves this by:

  - **Multi-source integration**: Connect Confluence, SharePoint, Google Drive, OneDrive, Jira, Slack, and more to centralize knowledge.
  - **Source-grounded AI**: Every answer is anchored to internal sources with citations, eliminating hallucinations.
  - **Creative outputs**: Generate mind maps, podcasts, reports, or Q&A from raw data.
  - **SME-friendly**: Affordable, easy to deploy, no AI specialists required.

  According to McKinsey’s 2026 report, Vietnamese SMEs can improve productivity by 20–30% with an intelligent knowledge base, especially in banking, insurance, and manufacturing.

  ## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Smart Knowledge Base with Prisma

  Prisma makes KB creation simple with just a few essential steps. Assume you’ve already registered for a free demo (see the end of the article).

  ### Step 1: Prepare and Integrate Data Sources

  - Deploy Prisma on-premise (internal server) or private cloud. CMC’s team supports setup in 30–60 minutes.
  - Integrate tools:
    - **Notion**: Connect via API to sync pages and databases — for example, importing SOP processes for training KB.
    - **Confluence**: Import wiki pages and documentation — ideal for legal teams storing contracts.
    - **SharePoint**: Pull files from document libraries (PDF, Excel) — suitable for banks storing financial reports.
  - How-to: In Prisma’s interface, select **Connectors** → Add API key → Choose source → Enable auto-sync. Prisma supports text, audio, and video formats.

  ### Step 2: Upload and Process Internal Data

  - Upload files manually or automatically from integrated sources. Prisma uses embeddings and indexing to convert data into searchable vectors.
  - Multi-modal processing: Example — upload a meeting video, Prisma extracts transcripts and generates summaries.
  - SME tip: Start with 10–20 representative files (e.g., sales SOPs from Notion) for initial testing.

  ### Step 3: Build the Smart KB with Queries & Advanced Outputs

  - Use the chat interface to query:  
    *“Summarize the credit appraisal process from Notion and Confluence files.”*  
    Results include source citations.
  - Create mind maps: Choose **Mindmap** output — Prisma visualizes structured knowledge (e.g., financial risk maps from Excel reports).
  - Create podcasts: Select **Podcast** output — transform a financial report PDF from SharePoint into a 5–10 minute audio briefing with natural voice.
  - How-to: After generating a response, select **Output Options** → Mindmap/Podcast → Export (PNG for mind maps, MP3 for podcasts).

  ### Step 4: Integrate into Daily Workflows

  - Connect Prisma with Slack or Microsoft Teams for quick KB queries within chat.
  - Set access permissions: R&D teams view production data, legal teams access contracts.
  - Maintenance: Prisma automatically updates when source content changes (e.g., Notion edits sync to KB).

  ### Step 5: Monitor and Expand

  - Track usage through dashboards: query counts, popular sources.
  - Expand capabilities: Add AI models (Grok for creativity, DeepSeek for cost efficiency) to optimize performance.

  ## Real-World Examples for Vietnamese Enterprises

  - **Mid-sized bank**: Integrate SharePoint (financial Excel reports) + Notion (SBV regulations) → Generate NPL risk mind maps or quarterly meeting summary podcasts for internal sharing.
  - **Insurance company**: Confluence (policy templates) + meeting videos → Query “Exclusion clause for disease X” → Export an explanatory podcast for agents.
  - **Manufacturer**: Notion (production SOPs) + testing videos → Create mind maps optimizing LED parameters and reduce R&D time.

  These examples help SMEs save hours each week and boost efficiency without complex IT infrastructure.

  ## Key Benefits of Building a Knowledge Base with Prisma

  - **Security & compliance**: Data stays internal, avoiding risks of public cloud tools.
  - **Cost savings**: SMEs avoid buying multiple separate tools — Prisma integrates everything affordably.
  - **Ease of use**: User-friendly interface, no coding required.
  - **Flexibility**: Custom mind maps and podcasts, strong Vietnamese language support.
