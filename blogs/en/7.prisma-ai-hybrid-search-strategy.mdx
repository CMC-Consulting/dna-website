## Introduction

In the era of big data, information retrieval goes beyond simple keyword matching—it requires understanding semantics and context. Prisma AI uses **Hybrid Search** technology to ensure optimal accuracy when retrieving information from personal and enterprise knowledge bases.

## 1. Two Pillars of Hybrid Search in Prisma AI

Prisma AI's search system is built on the combination of two complementary methods:

### Vector Search (Semantic Search)

Uses embedding models to transform text into mathematical vectors. This method allows the system to find information based on **meaning and concepts**, even when users don't use the exact words found in the documents.

**Technical Features:**
- Uses **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes
- Applies **cosine** distance for vector queries
- Extremely fast query speed with high accuracy

### Full-text Search (Keyword Search)

Leverages PostgreSQL's capabilities with **tsvector** and **tsquery** to perform traditional keyword searches. This method is extremely effective for finding:

- Technical terminology
- Error codes
- Specific names

These are cases where vector search might sometimes miss. The system utilizes **GIN** indexes to optimize text lookups.

| Method | Advantages | Technology |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Vector Search** | Understands semantics, finds by meaning | HNSW Index, Cosine Distance |
| **Full-text Search** | Precise keywords, technical terms | tsvector, tsquery, GIN Index |

## 2. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) Algorithm: The Heart of Accuracy

The breakthrough of Prisma AI lies in using the **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** algorithm to merge results from both search methods.

### RRF Processing Workflow

**Step 1: Separate Ranking**

The system performs Semantic Search and Keyword Search queries in parallel, then assigns each document a rank based on relevance in each method.

**Step 2: Calculate RRF Score**

Prisma AI applies the formula:

```
Score = 1.0 / (k + Rank_Vector) + 1.0 / (k + Rank_Text)
```

Where the constant **k** is typically set to **60** to balance weights between the two methods.

**Step 3: Merge Results**

Documents from both sources are combined through a **FULL OUTER JOIN**. Documents appearing in high positions in both ranking lists receive the highest combined scores.

**Step 4: Sort and Filter**

Finally, the system re-sorts the entire list by descending RRF score and extracts only the most relevant chunks to send to the LLM for processing.

### RRF Process Illustration

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Vector Search  │     │ Full-text Search│
│    (Semantic)   │     │   (Keyword)     │
└────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
         │                       │
         ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Rank: 1,2,3   │     │   Rank: 1,2,3   │
│   Doc A, B, C   │     │   Doc B, D, A   │
└────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
         │                       │
         └───────────┬───────────┘
                     ▼
         ┌───────────────────────┐
         │   FULL OUTER JOIN     │
         │   + RRF Score Calc    │
         └───────────┬───────────┘
                     ▼
         ┌───────────────────────┐
         │  Final Ranked List    │
         │  Doc B > A > C > D    │
         └───────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Why is Hybrid Search Important?

This combination helps Prisma AI overcome the limitations of each individual method:

### Increased Recall

Ensures no information is missed thanks to the ability to search by both keywords and meaning. When one method misses, the other compensates.

### Increased Precision

The RRF algorithm prioritizes truly relevant documents, helping AI deliver focused answers and **avoid hallucination**.

### Transparency with Citations

Thanks to Hybrid Search finding the exact original text passages, Prisma AI can attach accurate **Citations** to specific document IDs, allowing users to easily verify sources.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **High Recall** | No important information missed |
| **High Precision** | Accurate, relevant results |
| **Transparency** | Clear source citations |
| **Reliability** | Minimized AI hallucination |

## Conclusion

With powerful Hybrid Search technology, Prisma AI is not just a search tool, but a **digital brain** capable of finding and connecting the smallest pieces of knowledge in your massive data repository in a scientific and reliable manner.

The combination of Vector Search and Full-text Search, orchestrated by the RRF algorithm, creates a superior search system—where semantics and keywords work together to deliver the best results for users.
