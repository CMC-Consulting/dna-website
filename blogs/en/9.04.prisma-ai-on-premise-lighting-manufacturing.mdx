In the era of Industry 4.0, AI is no longer a distant concept. However, in a highly technical and fiercely competitive industry like lighting equipment manufacturing, the biggest question is not *“Should we use AI?”* but *“How can we use AI without losing our technological secrets?”*

This is where **Prisma**, a **Private AI (internal AI)** solution, emerges as a true game-changer.

---

### **1. When “Technological Secrets” Are Mission-Critical Assets**

The lighting industry is more than just assembly. It combines semiconductor materials, phosphor chemistry, thermal design, and smart connectivity protocols (IoT). These formulas and processes form the backbone of the business.

Unlike public AI tools, **Prisma** is deployed directly on the company’s own servers (on-premise). This means every technical CAD drawing, optical formula, or pricing strategy **never leaves your firewall**. You gain the power of artificial intelligence — but more importantly, you retain full ownership and control of your data.

### **2. From Traditional R&D to “Hyper-Speed R&D”**

Imagine a new engineer being able to query 20 years of company testing history in just seconds:

- *“Under what conditions did the 2018 Highbay LED line typically experience thermal issues?”*  
- *“Based on historical data, suggest the optimal current parameters for a new LED chip to achieve a 50,000-hour lifespan.”*

**Prisma** acts as an internal expert advisor, helping shorten product development (R&D) cycles from months to weeks by synthesizing and analyzing historical data — without manually digging through thousands of PDF files.

### **3. Optimizing the Factory Floor: Eliminating Downtime**

On a smart lighting production line, even a minor issue with an SMT chip placement machine can result in losses worth billions of VND. With **Prisma**, operators can interact directly with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) using natural language:

- **Ask:** *“The machine shows error E105 — what’s the quick fix?”*  
- **Answer:** The AI instantly extracts the relevant repair instructions for that equipment, along with notes from previous maintenance cases.

### **4. Personalizing Lighting Solutions for Customers**

A major trend today is **Human-Centric Lighting** — designing lighting systems that support human health and well-being. Each project (hospitals, schools, factories) requires a tailored lighting scenario.

**Prisma** helps the sales team create highly customized solution proposals based on the company’s vast project library, increasing bid win rates and customer satisfaction.

### **5. Conclusion: Don’t Just Manufacture Light Bulbs — Manufacture Knowledge**

The lighting industry is shifting from “selling devices” to “delivering living-space solutions.” In this journey, data is the fuel, and **Prisma – Private AI** is the engine. Owning an internal AI system not only optimizes costs but also builds a strong technological barrier against competitors.

**It’s time to turn dusty files on your hard drive into revenue-generating knowledge assets.**
