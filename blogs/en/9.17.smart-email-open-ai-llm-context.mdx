In the architecture of Smart Email Agent, artificial intelligence plays not just a supporting role but acts as the "brain" that understands and processes natural language. By leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs) such as **GPT-3.5 and GPT-4** through the **Azure OpenAI** service, the system has transformed how businesses interact with email data.

**1. Prompt Engineering: The Art of Controlling Advanced AI**

Instead of retraining models from scratch (which is costly and time-consuming), our solution uses sophisticated **Prompt Engineering** to guide AI behavior.

• **Contextual Guidance:** Meticulously designed commands allow AI to understand specialized terminology such as logistics and agricultural exports.

• **Output Shaping:** The system guides the AI ​​on how to extract raw data and transform it into meaningful information structures tailored to the specific business requirements.

**2. Precise Entity Classification:**

The true power of GPT-3.5/4 lies in its ability to deeply understand context to classify and extract key business entities:

• **Intelligent Recognition:** AI automatically analyzes email content to identify entities such as **vessel names, bill of lading (BOL), contract IDs**, and related legal entities.

• **Intentional Classification:** Beyond keywords, AI can differentiate between a "Shipping Notice," an "Invoice," or a "Customer Support Request" based on the nuances of the email.

• **Metazo enrichment:** Extracted information is stored in the **Azure Cosmos DB**, transforming unstructured emails into structured data, ready for search and reporting.

**3. Content summarization: Distilling information from long texts**

For complex email exchanges, the **Summarizer Model** uses Azure OpenAI to create concise summaries:

• **Capturing the core:** AI "reads" the entire content and attachments (if any) to filter out the key points, helping users understand the issue in seconds instead of minutes.

• **Consistency:** Summarizes are presented coherently, maintaining the context of the original conversation, greatly supporting quick decision-making.

**4. Self-Learning Mechanism via Dynamic Prompt Adjustment**

The unique aspect of our AI strategy is its ability to **adapt without fine-tuning (model retraining)**:

• **Feedback Loop:** When users manually edit labels on the Web Portal, the system recognizes and performs **Dynamic Prompt Adjustment**.

• **Cost Optimization:** This technique helps AI better understand the unique rules of the business and continuously improve accuracy over time while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

**5. Conclusion**

The combination of OpenAI's powerful pre-training models and proprietary Prompt Engineering techniques enables Smart Email Agent to achieve superior flexibility and accuracy, meeting the most demanding data management requirements of businesses.
