As Vietnam’s banking and finance sector faces an overwhelming volume of data—from financial statements and legal regulations to customer dossiers—manual information processing is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. **CMC Consulting** proudly introduces **Prisma** — an advanced AI solution that functions as a reliable “unstructured data analysis assistant.” With the ability to summarize, query, and provide precise source citations from documents hundreds of pages long, Prisma helps financial professionals save time, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance. Let’s explore real-world use cases designed specifically for the Vietnamese banking environment.

### **1. Financial Statement and Annual Report Analysis**

Investment analysts often struggle with stacks of PDF financial reports from major banks such as VCB, TCB, or BIDV. Prisma turns this complex task into a process that takes just a few clicks.

- **How to use:** Upload financial reports into Prisma.  
- **Key value:** Ask the AI to compare Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratios over the last three years or extract key risk factors from management discussion sections. Prisma cross-checks figures across pages quickly, enabling more accurate investment decisions.

---

### **2. Credit Underwriting and Risk Assessment**

In the credit appraisal process, officers must consolidate information from legal documents, credit rating reports, and transaction histories of corporate clients — a complex and time-intensive task.

- **How to use:** Upload all relevant documents into Prisma.  
- **Key value:** Ask questions such as, *“What warning signs about cash flow appear in these documents?”* or *“Which valuation method was used for the collateral?”* Prisma provides in-depth analysis with precise document citations, helping reduce credit risk and speed up approval processes.

---

### **3. Regulatory Research and Compliance (Compliance / Internal Audit)**

Vietnam’s banking industry operates under numerous Circulars and Decrees from the State Bank of Vietnam, including regulations on capital adequacy and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Manual lookup can take hours.

- **How to use:** Build a digital library of relevant Circulars within Prisma.  
- **Key value:** Controllers can quickly ask, *“According to the latest regulation in this document set, what is the lending limit for a single customer?”* Prisma can reduce research time by up to 80% while ensuring compliance without missing critical details.

### **4. Wealth Management and Personal Financial Advisory**

Financial advisors must personalize strategies for each client based on market outlooks and risk profiles — a task requiring high flexibility and fast information synthesis.

- **How to use:** Upload weekly market reports and client profile data.  
- **Key value:** Generate FAQ-style summaries or even audio overviews to make insights easier for clients to understand. Prisma supports personalized investment suggestions, increasing client satisfaction and portfolio management performance.

### **5. Internal Training and Onboarding**

Banking operational procedures (SOPs) are often lengthy and difficult for new employees to absorb quickly.

- **How to use:** Upload branch operation procedures or card issuance processes into Prisma.  
- **Key value:** New employees can “chat” directly with the system, asking questions like, *“If a customer loses their card overseas, what is the first step to take?”* This reduces the burden on supervisors and accelerates effective onboarding.
