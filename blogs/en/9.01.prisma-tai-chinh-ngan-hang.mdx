Searching for and referencing accounting guidance is one of the biggest challenges for bank accountants, especially as regulations are frequently updated and amended. Prisma by CMC Consulting helps bank accounting departments optimize their research processes, reduce errors, and save significant time.

Let’s explore the specific ways Prisma supports bank accounting teams:

### 1. Reduce Time Spent Searching for Accounting Guidance

Based on our experience working with clients, searching for accounting guidance across dense legal documents and internal regulations is the most time-consuming task.

**Smart search:** Prisma allows accountants to upload large volumes of documents such as Circulars and Decrees (for example, the latest Circular 99/2025/TT-BTC replacing Circular 200) as well as the bank’s internal policies.

**24/7 research assistant:** Instead of manually flipping through documents, accountants can ask Prisma to clarify complex concepts, synthesize detailed information, and significantly reduce the time spent “looking for answers.”

**Updating new regulations for banks:** Circular 99/2025/TT-BTC introduces new provisions that also apply to credit institutions and foreign bank branches for non-specific operations such as inventory, fixed assets, and receivables/payables. Prisma helps accountants quickly identify these changes and apply them accurately for the 2026 financial year.

### 2. Ensure Accuracy and Transparency (Clear Citations)

In the banking sector, accuracy and legal compliance are top priorities.

**Source citations:** Unlike public AI solutions, Prisma provides clear citations linked directly to the original source documents for every answer, allowing accountants to see exactly which page and section the information comes from within the uploaded materials.

**Reducing AI “hallucinations”:** By strictly referencing the organization’s actual documents, Prisma minimizes the risk of generating inaccurate or fabricated information, giving accountants greater confidence when recording accounting entries.

### 3. Support for Handling Complex and Error-Prone Transactions

Bank accountants often face challenges with common accounting errors related to cash, deposits, fixed assets, or taxes.

**Analysis and reconciliation:** Accountants can upload lists of common errors or procedures for handling invoice mistakes under Decree 70/2025/ND-CP, and Prisma can help quickly review the required steps, such as preparing Form 04/SS-HĐĐT or issuing adjustment/replacement invoices.

**Guidance on accounting for new tax rules:** Prisma can assist in explaining how to account for Personal Income Tax (PIT) under the new family deduction thresholds effective from 2026 (15.5 million VND for taxpayers) or changes in VAT rates across different goods and service categories.

### 4. Control of Sensitive Data Security

Banking financial data is extremely sensitive and requires strict security controls.

**Secure internal environment (Self-hosted):** Prisma supports deployment on the organization’s private infrastructure (self-hosted), ensuring that sensitive data remains entirely within the internal secure environment and is not leaked externally or used to train public AI models.

**Privacy:** Prisma is built with strong security measures, ensuring that sensitive research conducted by the accounting department remains confidential.

### 5. Standardizing Knowledge Across Departments

**Common language:** Prisma helps create a “common language” of information across departments within the bank, enabling accounting teams to collaborate more smoothly with related departments when reconciliation or data explanations are required.

In summary, Prisma transforms bank accounting departments from spending excessive time on manual tasks and document searches to focusing on in-depth analysis and informed decision-making, based on reliable internal documentation.
