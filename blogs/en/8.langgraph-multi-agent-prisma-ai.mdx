## Introduction

In Prisma AI's architecture, instead of using a single language model to handle all requests, we implement a **Multi-Agent** architecture powered by **LangGraph**. This system operates as a **State Machine**, where specialized AI Agents coordinate seamlessly through a **Shared Memory** called State to complete complex tasks with high accuracy and aesthetic quality.

Below is how the trio **"Planner - Narrator - Designer"** collaborates to transform raw data into professional presentations and reports.

## 1. Strategic Planner: The "Architect" of Planning

Every process begins with the **Strategic Planner**, an agent that acts as a strategic consulting expert.

### Deep Analysis

This Agent scans through all source documents and user queries to identify:
- Target audience
- Appropriate tone
- Communication objectives

### Framework Design

The Planner builds a **logical Outline** with strict rules:
- Each heading must be a complete sentence
- Concise and no more than 12 words
- Ensuring professionalism and coherence

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         STRATEGIC PLANNER           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Input: Source docs + Query         │
│                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │  1. Analyze audience        │    │
│  │  2. Determine tone          │    │
│  │  3. Build Outline           │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                     │
│  Output: Logical Outline            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 2. Narrative Story Agent: The "Storyteller" of Content

Once the framework is ready, the **Narrative Story Agent (Narrator)** takes over to breathe life into the content.

### Knowledge Extraction

Using **Long Context LLM** models, this agent "reads" deeply into documents to write key points for each section:
- Extract important information
- Synthesize data from multiple sources
- Create coherent and logical content

### Logical Thinking

Instead of just listing raw data, the Narrator focuses on answering the question **"Why?"** to:
- Prove and defend the core message
- Build persuasive arguments
- Connect ideas logically

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Long Context** | Read and understand lengthy documents |
| **Logical thinking** | Answer "Why?" instead of just "What?" |
| **Storytelling** | Transform data into compelling narratives |

## 3. Visual Reasoning & Layout Agent: The "Artist" of Visuals

When content is ready, the aesthetic-focused agents **(Designer)** join to optimize the visual experience.

### Visual Reasoning Agent

AI analyzes content to make intelligent decisions:

**Case 1: Processes or hierarchical structures**
- Automatically generate **Mermaid** code to draw diagrams
- Visually represent workflows
- Show relationships between components

**Case 2: Abstract concepts**
- Compose prompts for **DALL-E 3** to create unique illustrations
- Design images appropriate to the context
- Enhance content visualization

### Layout Design Agent

This agent determines the optimal page layout based on the presence of visual assets:

| Layout | Description | Used When |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **SPLIT** | Split text and image | Has illustrations |
| **FULL** | Full text content | Pure text content |
| **VISUAL** | Image-centered | Main charts, diagrams |

## Perfect Coordination Mechanism via LangGraph

This coordination is not random but tightly controlled through **LangGraph's data flows**.

### State Machine Architecture

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   PLANNER    │────▶│   NARRATOR   │────▶│   DESIGNER   │
└──────┬───────┘     └──────┬───────┘     └──────┬───────┘
       │                    │                    │
       ▼                    ▼                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              PRESENTATION STATE (Shared Memory)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Outline          • Content           • Visuals       │
│  • Target Audience  • Key Messages      • Layouts       │
│  • Tone             • Arguments         • PPTX Output   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Controlled Data Flow

Data flows in a controlled manner between steps, allowing agents to:
- **Read** from the shared PresentationState
- **Write** results to State after each processing step
- **Synchronize** information between Agents

This ensures the entire system remains **consistent** from the planning stage to the final PPTX file export.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Agent architecture with LangGraph in Prisma AI demonstrates the power of intelligent coordination:

- **Planner** ensures clear strategy and structure
- **Narrator** creates content with depth and logic
- **Designer** delivers professional visual experience

This combination not only produces high-quality outputs but also ensures consistency and scalability for complex tasks in the future.
