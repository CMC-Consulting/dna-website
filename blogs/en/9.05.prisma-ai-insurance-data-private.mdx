In the insurance industry, **trust** and **data** are the two most valuable assets. However, adopting public AI tools has made many executives concerned about the risk of exposing customers’ health and financial information.

**Prisma (Private AI)** emerges as the perfect solution: bringing the power of artificial intelligence into business operations while keeping data securely locked inside the company’s own “vault.”

### **1. Claims Assessment: From Days to Minutes**

One of the biggest challenges for claims departments is cross-checking medical records against hundreds of pages of policy terms and conditions.

- **With Prisma:** The system automatically scans claim documents, cross-references exclusion rules, and provides instant approval recommendations. It works like an in-house legal expert, operating 24/7 with high accuracy, improving customer experience at the very moment they need their insurer most.

### **2. A “Super Assistant” for Thousands of Agents (Agent Support)**

Insurance agents are expected to remember a massive amount of knowledge, from product benefits to operational procedures.

- Instead of calling the support department, an agent can simply ask Prisma:  
  *“A 35-year-old male customer who smokes wants to join a savings plan — what is the optimal premium?”*  

- The system returns a personalized advisory scenario, fully aligned with the latest regulations, helping agents close deals on the spot.

### **3. More Accurate Risk Underwriting**

Issuing policies requires synthesizing information from multiple sensitive data sources. Prisma can analyze historical data patterns to detect potential insurance fraud or flag unusual health risk indicators that humans might miss — while ensuring all personally identifiable information (PII) is stored on-premise in compliance with cybersecurity regulations.

### **4. Compliance Control – A Strong Legal Shield**

Insurance business regulations are frequently updated. Prisma helps legal and compliance teams review marketing campaigns and sales processes to ensure that all wording aligns with Ministry of Finance regulations, avoiding administrative penalties or unnecessary legal disputes.

### **5. Why Prisma On-Premise?**

Unlike tools such as Google NotebookLM or ChatGPT, Prisma is installed directly on the insurance company’s own server infrastructure:

- **Maximum security:** Customer data never leaves the internal network.  
- **Deep customization:** The AI is trained on your company’s own terminology and operational rules.  
- **Stable operation:** No dependency on internet connectivity or policy changes from external cloud providers.
