  In Vietnam’s digital transformation era, enterprises are facing massive volumes of data from many different sources: from lengthy PDF financial reports and complex Excel spreadsheets to recorded meeting audio and executive video sessions. The biggest challenge is no longer storage — it is how to **process and extract value** from this data efficiently and securely, without exposing sensitive information.

  This is where **Prisma** – CMC Consulting’s **Private AI** solution – truly stands out with its **versatile data support**, enabling seamless processing of multiple data formats while maintaining absolute security through on-premise/self-hosted deployment.

  This article explores how Prisma handles multi-modal data and highlights real business benefits for Vietnamese enterprises in banking, insurance, manufacturing, and finance. We also include concrete examples, such as summarizing executive meeting videos or creating podcasts from financial reports, so you can clearly see the value.

  ## What Is Versatile Data Support and Why Do Vietnamese Enterprises Need It?

  Versatile data support refers to an AI system’s ability to process diverse data sources without manual conversion. In Vietnamese enterprise environments — where the 2026 Digital Technology Law and the Cybersecurity Law require strict data protection — using public AI tools (such as ChatGPT or NotebookLM) can introduce serious data leakage risks, especially for sensitive assets like customer records or proprietary technology.

  Prisma excels by offering:

  - **Multi-format support**: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, audio (MP3, WAV), video (MP4, AVI), and even links from Notion, Confluence, and SharePoint.
  - **Source-grounded & private processing**: All outputs are anchored to your original data with precise citations and processed entirely within your own infrastructure — no third-party public cloud.
  - **Advanced outputs**: Beyond summaries, Prisma can generate mind maps, reports, Q&A, or even podcasts — turning raw data into actionable insights.

  This helps enterprises save time, reduce human error, and stay compliant with local regulations.

  ## How Prisma Processes Multi-Modal Data

  Prisma leverages **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** combined with **multi-modal AI** to process each data type effectively. Below is a detailed breakdown:

  ### 1. PDF & Text Documents (Docs, Slides)

  Prisma scans content, extracts text, tables, and images. For example, when uploading a hundreds-page PDF financial report, Prisma can quickly summarize key indicators (such as NPL – non-performing loans) and compare trends across quarters.

  **Real-world example**: In banking, the legal team uploads State Bank of Vietnam circulars (PDF) and asks: “What is the latest lending limit regulation?” — Prisma responds with answers and exact page-level citations.

  ### 2. Excel & Spreadsheets

  Prisma analyzes numerical data, formulas, and charts. It can consolidate data from multiple sheets and automatically generate reports.

  **Real-world example**: Upload an Excel file containing historical customer transactions, and Prisma identifies cash-flow patterns, flags potential credit risks, and outputs the results as a mind map or PDF report.

  ### 3. Audio (Meeting Recordings, Podcasts)

  Prisma converts audio to text (speech-to-text) and then summarizes or analyzes the content.

  **Real-world example**: Upload an executive meeting audio file (e.g., a 2026 strategy discussion). Prisma summarizes key points, references exact timestamps (e.g., “At minute 15:30, the CEO mentioned 20% growth”), and can even generate a concise internal podcast.

  ### 4. Video (Online Meetings, Training Sessions)

  Prisma processes video by extracting frames, subtitles, and audio, then consolidates everything into actionable insights. This powerful multi-modal capability turns long videos into concise summaries.

  **Real-world example**: Upload a leadership meeting video (from Zoom or Teams). Prisma summarizes key decisions, extracts presentation slides, and creates a Q&A report. Alternatively, from a financial earnings call video, Prisma generates an audio podcast so employees can quickly listen instead of watching the full recording — ideal for internal training.

  ## Concrete Examples: Executive Meeting Video Summaries & Podcasts from Financial Reports

  - **Executive meeting video summary**: Upload a 60-minute quarterly meeting video, and Prisma produces a structured summary:
    - Part 1 (0–15 min): Budget discussion – 15% IT budget increase  
    - Part 2 (15–30 min): Market risks – diversification proposed  
    - Part 3: Conclusion – 2026 revenue targets  
    Each section includes timestamps and speaker references (when voice identification is enabled).

  - **Podcast from financial reports**: Upload a PDF financial report together with shareholder meeting audio/video. Prisma generates a 5–10 minute podcast:
    - Introduction: Q4 2025 revenue summary  
    - Main section: NPL analysis and 2026 outlook  
    - Conclusion: Investment recommendations  
    This enables financial advisors to share insights quickly with clients, improving wealth management efficiency.

  These examples show that Prisma doesn’t just process data — it **transforms** it into practical, action-driven assets for busy Vietnamese enterprises.
