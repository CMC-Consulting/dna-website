In Vietnam’s accelerating digital transformation era, businesses are dealing with massive volumes of data from diverse sources: thick PDF financial reports, complex Excel spreadsheets, meeting audio recordings, and executive video conferences. The biggest challenge is no longer just storage — it is **processing and extracting value** from this data efficiently and securely, without exposing sensitive information.

This is where **Prisma** — CMC Consulting’s Private AI solution — stands out with its **versatile data support**, enabling seamless handling of multiple formats while maintaining strict data security through on-premise or self-hosted deployment.

This article explores how Prisma processes multimodal data and highlights practical benefits for Vietnamese enterprises in banking, insurance, manufacturing, and finance. We’ll walk through real-world scenarios such as summarizing leadership meeting videos or generating podcasts from financial reports to demonstrate tangible value.

## What Is Versatile Data Support and Why Do Vietnamese Businesses Need It?

Versatile data support refers to an AI system’s ability to process various data sources without manual conversion. In Vietnamese enterprises — where the Digital Technology Law 2026 and Cybersecurity Law demand strict data protection — using public AI tools (like ChatGPT or NotebookLM) can pose risks of data leakage, especially with sensitive customer or proprietary information.

Prisma addresses this by offering:

- **Multi-format support**: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, audio (MP3, WAV), video (MP4, AVI), and links from Notion, Confluence, SharePoint.
- **Source-grounded & private AI**: All processing is anchored to your internal data with precise citations and runs fully within your infrastructure (no third-party cloud exposure).
- **Advanced outputs**: Beyond summaries, Prisma can generate mind maps, reports, Q&A, or podcasts — transforming raw data into actionable insights.

This helps businesses save time, reduce human errors, and stay compliant with local regulations.

## How Prisma Processes Multimodal Data

Prisma uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** combined with **multimodal AI** to handle different data types intelligently.

### 1. PDF & Text Documents (Docs, Slides)

Prisma scans and extracts text, tables, and images.  
For example, upload a 200-page financial report PDF — Prisma can quickly summarize key metrics (such as NPL ratios) and compare performance across quarters.

**Real-world example:**  
A bank’s compliance team uploads a State Bank regulation PDF and asks:  
*"What is the latest lending limit under current regulations?"*  
Prisma answers with exact citations and page references.

### 2. Excel & Spreadsheets

Prisma analyzes numerical data, formulas, and charts. It can consolidate multiple sheets and generate automated reports.

**Real-world example:**  
Upload a customer transaction history spreadsheet. Prisma detects cash flow trends, flags credit risk patterns, and outputs a mind map or summary report.

### 3. Audio (Meeting Recordings, Voice Notes)

Prisma converts audio into text using speech-to-text, then summarizes or analyzes the content.

**Real-world example:**  
Upload a leadership strategy meeting recording. Prisma summarizes key points, references timestamps (e.g., *“At 15:30, the CEO discussed 20% growth targets”*), and can even produce a short internal podcast recap.

### 4. Video (Online Meetings, Training Sessions)

Prisma processes video by extracting frames, subtitles, and audio, then synthesizes insights. This powerful multimodal capability condenses long content into digestible knowledge.

**Real-world example:**  
Upload a 60-minute executive meeting video from Zoom or Teams. Prisma identifies decisions, extracts slide content, and generates a structured Q&A report.  
It can also turn a financial earnings call video into a short podcast summary for staff training — saving hours of review time.

## Concrete Use Cases

### Executive Meeting Video Summary
Upload a quarterly leadership meeting video. Prisma breaks it down:

- **Part 1 (0–15 min):** Budget discussion — IT investment increased by 15%  
- **Part 2 (15–30 min):** Market risk — diversification strategy proposed  
- **Part 3:** Conclusion — 2026 revenue targets defined  

Each insight includes timestamps and speaker references (if voice recognition is enabled).

### Podcast from Financial Reports
Upload a financial report PDF plus earnings call recording. Prisma creates a 5–10 minute podcast:

- Introduction: Q4 2025 revenue overview  
- Main section: NPL analysis and 2026 outlook  
- Closing: Investment recommendations  

Financial advisors can quickly share these summaries with clients, improving wealth management efficiency.
