In traditional AI systems, improving accuracy often requires complex and costly model retraining (fine-tuning). **Smart Email Agent** breaks this barrier with **Dynamic Prompt Adjustment** technology, allowing the system to learn and improve during real-world operation without requiring in-depth technical intervention.

**1. Optimized Cost and Performance (Compared to Fine-tuning)**

Instead of performing resource-intensive and time-consuming model retraining, our solution focuses on a more flexible and cost-effective approach:

• **No retraining required from scratch:** The system leverages the power of pre-trained models such as GPT-3.5/4 and only fine-tunes how the AI ​​"understands" requests through continuously updated sets of prompts.

• **Instant Adaptation:** AI is capable of changing classification and summarization behavior immediately upon receiving feedback, helping businesses respond quickly to changes in business processes.

**2. Human-in-the-loop Feedback Loop**

The power of self-learning lies in the combination of artificial intelligence and human supervision through a closed-loop process:

• **Feedback Recording:** When users make manual label edits (e.g., correcting ship names or contract codes) on the Web Portal, the system meticulously records these edits.

• **Sending Data to AI Trainer:** Error correction information is sent directly to the **AI Trainer (Feedback-based Relearning)** department.

• **Category Mapping Logic Adjustment:** The system automatically updates category mapping logic and adjusts prompt content so that subsequent classifications achieve higher accuracy, closely matching user expectations and industry-specific nuances.

**3. Outstanding Benefits for Businesses**

The self-learning mechanism through Dynamic Prompt Adjustment provides sustainable value to the data management system:

• **Continuously Improved Accuracy:** The more it is used, the "smarter" the system becomes and the better it understands your business's unique language.

• **Prompt-Based Control:** The ability to fine-tune classification behavior by adjusting commands provides maximum flexibility while maintaining simplicity in management.

• **Ensuring Consistency:** Helps eliminate discrepancies in automatic classification, ensuring email data is always organized scientifically and accurately.
