Amid Vietnam’s AI boom, enterprises face a major challenge: how to integrate AI effectively without being locked into a single vendor. Prisma — CMC Consulting’s Private AI platform — provides the answer with **flexible model selection**. Businesses can freely choose among leading AI models such as Grok (xAI), DeepSeek, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Claude (Anthropic), Mistral, and more. This flexibility optimizes cost and performance while ensuring maximum data security through on-premise or self-hosted deployment.

This article analyzes Prisma’s model flexibility and compares at least six popular AI models to help Vietnamese enterprises select the right fit — whether in banking, insurance, manufacturing, or finance. Key evaluation criteria include cost, speed, accuracy, Vietnamese language support, customization capability, and compliance with local regulations such as Vietnam’s Cybersecurity Law and Digital Technology Law.

## Why Flexible Model Selection Matters in 2026

In 2026, AI adoption in Vietnam is accelerating alongside tighter regulations from the State Bank of Vietnam and the Ministry of Information and Communications. AI systems must meet strict data security and digital sovereignty requirements. Vendor lock-in (for example, relying solely on OpenAI) creates risks: sudden price increases, policy changes, or exposure of sensitive data via public cloud integrations.

Prisma addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Multi-model integration**: Switch between LLMs without changing your code or infrastructure  
- **No vendor lock-in**: Prisma acts as a neutral orchestration layer using open APIs or local models  
- **Use-case optimization**: Choose high-speed models for R&D or high-security models for compliance  
- **Private processing**: Data remains source-grounded within your infrastructure

Below is a comparison of six AI models that Prisma can seamlessly integrate.

## AI Model Comparison for Vietnamese Enterprises (2026 Update)

| **Gemini 1.5** | Google | $4–$8 | Medium (40–80) | 87% | **Excellent** | Medium (Cloud-centric, Workspace integration) | Insurance marketing and personalized content |
| **Claude 3** | Anthropic | $6–$12 | Medium (40–90) | 86% | Good | High (Strong safety, low hallucination risk) | Legal, compliance, sensitive document review |
| **Mistral** | Mistral AI | $2–$5 | Very High (70–140) | 84% | Fair | **Excellent** (Local deployment, anti lock-in) | Manufacturing optimization and technical R&D |

### Key Analysis

- **Cost & Speed:** DeepSeek and Mistral stand out for affordability and performance, ideal for budget-conscious Vietnamese enterprises.  
- **Accuracy & Vietnamese Language:** Gemini excels in multilingual capability, while Claude and Grok perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks such as credit risk analysis.  
- **Security & Customization:** Open-source models like DeepSeek and Mistral are easier to deploy on-premise, reducing exposure risks under Vietnam’s data regulations.
