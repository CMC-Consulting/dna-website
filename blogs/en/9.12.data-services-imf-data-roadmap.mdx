For enterprise and financial institutions (BFSI), data only truly creates value when operated within a standardized and synchronized governance framework. **CMC Consulting** introduces the **Information Management Framework (IMF)** – an end-to-end data strategy that helps businesses move from building a vision to extracting real value from AI.

Our IMF model is designed with rigorous logic, ensuring sustainable development through core pillars:

• **Data Governance:** Answering questions about responsibility and authority. We help businesses establish organizational models (Data Owner, Steward, Custodian), build standardized policies and processes to avoid "data chaos," and ensure compliance and information security.

• **Data Quality:** Focusing on cleaning, standardizing, and enriching data. The core objective is to create a **"single version of truth"**, ensuring that the input data for AI reports and models is always accurate and reliable.

• **Data Management & Operations:** Building a solid technical foundation with modern storage architectures such as **Data Lake, Lakehouse, ODS** and flexible data stream/equilibrium flows (ETL/ELT), supporting both batch and real-time data processing.

• **Data Usage:** This is the layer that creates direct business impact. From intelligent management reports, businesses can move further to predictive analytics (Machine Learning) and apply **GenAI & Agent Platforms** to automate business processes.

• **Data Architecture:** Designing data models (Conceptual, Logical, Physical) according to international standards, helping businesses easily scale and minimize technical debt.

**The Differentiating Feature of CMC Consulting's Solution:** We believe that a successful data strategy doesn't start with technology, but with establishing **Governance – Quality – Architecture**, before moving on to deploying AI and GenAI. With IMF, every data initiative is closely linked between the IT, Business, Compliance, and Risk departments.
