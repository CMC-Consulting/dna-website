In traditional email management systems, searching often relies on keyword matching, which can easily lead to missed information if users don't remember the exact terminology in the email. **Smart Email Agent** overcomes this barrier by applying **Semantic Search**, allowing the system to understand the intent and context behind each user query.

**1. Converting Text into "Mathematical Language" (Vector Embeddings)**

The core of this technology is the process of converting unstructured email content into **Vector Embeddings**.

• **Embedding Model:** The system uses advanced Azure OpenAI models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) to transform text into multi-dimensional sequences of numbers (dense vectors).

• **Representing Meaning:** These vectors not only represent the literal meaning but also mathematically represent the **true meaning** of the text. Emails with contextually similar content will have vector coordinates that are close together in multidimensional space.

**2. Storage and Retrieval on Azure Cosmos DB**

Once created, these vectors require a specialized storage infrastructure to enable extremely fast searching.

• **Dedicated Vector Index:** Vector data is stored in a separate container called the **Vector Index Container** within Cosmos DB.

• **Search Optimization:** Instead of row-by-row searching, the system performs **vector similarity search**. When users ask questions in natural language, those questions are also converted into a vector, and the system quickly identifies emails whose vector is closest to the question vector.

**3. Actual Workflow**

The system handles semantic search through an automated and asynchronous workflow:

1. **Data Enrichment Phase:** When new emails are collected, the **Summarization Service** sends the content to the Azure OpenAI model to create the corresponding embedding vector.

2. **Storage Phase:** Both the original email content, the summary, and the embedding vector are stored synchronously in the Cosmos DB.

3. **Query Phase:** When a user enters a query (e.g., "Which ship carrying rice is delayed?"), the **Search Service** will call the Embedding model to convert the query into a vector and perform a matching on the Vector Index to return contextually accurate results.

**4. Breakthrough Benefits for Businesses**

Combining Vector Embeddings and Cosmos DB brings about a complete transformation in how information is discovered:

• **Understanding Search:** You can find information even without using the exact words in the email.

• **Superior Performance:** Fast retrieval capabilities on large data scales thanks to the distributed structure of Cosmos DB.

• **Flexible Combination:** The system can perform **Hybrid Query** – combining metadata filtering (such as date, ship name) and semantic search to deliver the most accurate results.
