# How to Add a New Blog Post

This guide explains how to add a new blog post to the DNA website.

## Overview

Blog posts are written in **MDX format** (Markdown + JSX) and organized by locale (language) in the `blogs/` directory.

## Directory Structure

```
blogs/
├── en/          # English posts
├── vi/          # Vietnamese posts
├── ja/          # Japanese posts
└── zh/          # Chinese posts
```

## Step 1: Create the MDX File

### File Naming Convention

Files follow this pattern: `{number}.{slug}.mdx`

- **Number**: Order/ID of the post (e.g., `11`)
- **Slug**: URL-friendly name with hyphens (e.g., `my-new-blog-post`)

**Example**: `11.my-new-blog-post.mdx`

### File Location

Place your file in the appropriate language folder:
- English: `blogs/en/11.my-new-blog-post.mdx`
- Vietnamese: `blogs/vi/11.my-new-blog-post.mdx`

## Step 2: Add Frontmatter

Every blog post must start with frontmatter (metadata between `---` delimiters):

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
description: "A brief description of your blog post (used for SEO and previews)"
slug: /my-new-blog-post
image: /blog/11.jpg
tags: tag1,tag2,tag3
date: 2026-01-21
visible: published
pin: false
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields Explained

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | The title displayed on the blog post |
| `description` | Yes | Short description for SEO and blog cards |
| `slug` | Yes | URL path (e.g., `/my-new-blog-post` → `/blog/my-new-blog-post`) |
| `image` | Yes | Cover image path (stored in `public/blog/`) |
| `tags` | Yes | Comma-separated tags for categorization |
| `date` | Yes | Publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| `visible` | Yes | Visibility status (see below) |
| `pin` | No | Set to `true` to pin the post at the top |

### Visibility Options

- `published` - Post is live and visible to everyone
- `draft` - Post is hidden (work in progress)
- `invisible` - Post exists but is not shown in listings

## Step 3: Add Cover Image

1. Prepare your cover image (recommended: 1200x630px for social sharing)
2. Name it to match your post number (e.g., `11.jpg`)
3. Place it in `public/blog/11.jpg`

## Step 4: Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your blog content using Markdown:

```mdx
---
title: "Understanding AI in Enterprise"
description: "A comprehensive guide to AI implementation"
slug: /understanding-ai-enterprise
image: /blog/11.jpg
tags: ai,enterprise,guide
date: 2026-01-21
visible: published
pin: false

## Step 5: Multi-language Support

To support multiple languages, create the same file in each locale folder:

1. `blogs/en/11.my-new-blog-post.mdx` - English version
2. `blogs/vi/11.my-new-blog-post.mdx` - Vietnamese version
3. `blogs/ja/11.my-new-blog-post.mdx` - Japanese version
4. `blogs/zh/11.my-new-blog-post.mdx` - Chinese version

**Important**: Use the same filename and slug across all locales.

## Complete Example

Here's a full example of a new blog post:

**File**: `blogs/en/11.getting-started-with-nextjs.mdx`

```mdx
---
title: "Getting Started with Next.js"
description: "Learn the fundamentals of Next.js and build your first application with this step-by-step guide."
slug: /getting-started-with-nextjs
image: /blog/11.jpg
tags: nextjs,react,tutorial,web-development
date: 2026-01-21
visible: published
pin: false
